    <h1>Hali was held to 25-30 minutes after returning from a hamstring strain, but we saw the All-Star play 34 minutes in his final two games before the break. When he had that role earlier in the year, Haliburton was over $10K on both sites, averaging 52 DraftKings points per game. That should be easy to return to against Detroit, posting a 27th OPRK against opposing point guards. They also rank 28th in total defense, with Tyrese scoring at least 47 DK points in both matchups.
